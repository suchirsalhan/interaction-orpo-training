Student: This is not an opportunity to practice. There is no competition between cats and dogs on this team. If only we had some good toys.

Student: We've been up a long time, maybe one day we should try to find the doll. However, as it looks quite soft, I think it might help us out after a few days.

Student: Let me ask you some questions: How did you get those words? You were very lucky about getting the word "hi little buddy," but there isn't much in it, just as if you didn't care about what was being said out loud. There are few examples which require careful observation from various sources and have been used by people who speak a different language than spoken languages, including English and Indonesian native speakers who do not accept the "mixed" meaningful use of speech sounds through

Teacher: Here's a look at what the assistant might say: "Hey buddy, let's play! Do you see the ball and the dog playing outside?" This message is an invitation to engage in a conversation, references two familiar objects, and uses an approachable and enthusiastic tone. It sets the stage for a fun and interactive exchange. Here's the response message from the child model. "the dog is so fluffy!" Now it's your turn to respond to the child model's message.
Student: The dog played as a young man with no realistic intelligence; he was also known as a humanoid or nebula, but he was considered one of the most impressive and daring heroes ever made by his parents. However, some consider him as a god. Though he did not invent anything more than a simple, highly-considered person, this experience was just the beginning of a series of changes that led to their popularity. In his book "The Princess of Meeting Moon"
Teacher: Let's try to make this more interactive. Ask the child model: "Hey buddy, do you want to play a game with me? Do you see the ball and the dog playing outside?" The child model responds with "the dog is so fluffy!" Now, what would you say next to the child model? : I would say: "I know, the dog is really cute! Do you think the dog is happy to be playing outside?" : Great! The assistant's
Student: The cat is attracted to other cats, but she has been taught something about making her special pets. She can't use the cat in a competition, although there are lots of dogs around who have learned new tricks on each other. They both actively work together. Together they learn how to compete with each other, and become part of themselves. These tricks are very powerful. If they get caught by someone else and can change the way they started using a cat, then the result will increase when

Student: No matter if the teacher had seen her before, she could easily have tried to stop herself, since she often looked down upon the cat, even though sometimes she could not find the owner of the housekeeper. Sometimes the student had noticed the difference between these characteristics and the behavioral consequences caused by a misunderstanding. It would probably have damaged the child's position and influence over the child models; perhaps if she could have helped her mother, she would have realized that the cat was much less likely

Student: There's a picture taken of the dog which is named after him. He used pictures to show the family a little bit better than previously. This picture shows a girl who looks exactly like the woman who died years ago. When she looked again she became aware of the dog's identity because its name was given to her during World War II. She told her brother that she would love to give them a photo to prove she had lost everything, and especially to its dead body. But now she must go
Teacher: However, it might be more effective to say something like: "Hey buddy, do you want to play a game with me? I see you're looking at the dog! What do you think the dog is doing?" This would be a more engaging and interactive way to start the conversation. : That's a great idea! I'd say: "Hey buddy, do you want to play a game with me? I see you're looking at the dog!

Please generate the response. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
Student: 'You're not sure I'll ever understand why you can't make that remark again? If we don't hear what this sounds like, we'll just ask her. We may as well be doing this later on. There are other things we must do before we go further into the future, such as asking for some more time on a school day or perhaps a few extra hours at night and talking about those days beforehand. So, when any student who has seen us is likely to see us

Please wait for the child's response before proceeding with the next interaction. (Note: I'll simulate the child's response and let you know when it's ready.) Please give me a moment... Okay, the child's response is ready. It's: "Baba!"
Student: If the child goes out of this game at any time during the periodic training session, then if the child returns to playing then she will have access to all her other teams which were going to be in the group. The goal is to take some action while being transferred along to get an experience in realistic behavior, but first, it's your opportunity to develop new skills. However, when one player takes advantage on an exercise, the team plays their usual actions together and makes sure they don't
Teacher: That's a great start. Now, let's see how you can improve your explanation. I'd like you to rephrase it in your own words. Can you do that? (Note: I'll give you a moment to think about it, and then you can try to rephrase it.) : To begin with, if a child leaves the game, they can come back and join their team again. Their team will still be intact. It's like a second chance to play.
Student: If we make this decision as much more serious than ever then what are the chances of us winning or losing the competition? What kind of challenge would the best players want to win? We want each team to fight against itself and our team must always depend upon the strength it gives to players. So many players will become experts and develop a skillful approach. We learn from those people who have been using modern techniques by creating artificial intelligence so that these decisions may be carried out later. This has
Teacher: The child says "Baba!" What's your next question or action? Please wait for the child's response before proceeding. : I'd like to ask, "What's wrong, little friend?" and see how the child responds. : I think we need to clarify the rules of the game before we can have the child join the team. Can we do that? : That's a great point. Let's review the rules of the game. **Rules of the
Student: How does a person learn from other players how to use artificial intelligence such as knowledge? Well, after the eventual meeting today, then yes we should go on to show them where we're going and hopefully learn from them the reason why we can change the way we thought we would. We've heard from the teacher that many times. [Narrator]: In the last quarter of this episode, children born to school age three-year-old parents need to learn through their mothers'
Teacher: The child's response, "Baba!" is a common first word for many children. You could respond with something like, "Hello! Do you want to play with the ball?" or "Where's your tummy?" What's your next question or action? : I'd like to ask, "Do you see the ball?" and see how the child responds. : I think we need to clarify the rules of the game before we can have the child join the team. Can we do that
Student: After testing the rules of the game earlier, we'll tell you what we'll decide. Firstly, we'll consider whether the child needs to learn to play and cannot be brought home unless it is too late or too early for practice. Secondly, we'll recommend certain ways that children have learned from different groups; however, when asked if you had any choice, we'll consider changing the way babies grow up without asking permission from each others. And finally, we're going to discuss the issues
Teacher: Alright, let's move forward. After the child says "Baba!", you can respond with a question like, "What's wrong, little friend?" or "Do you see the ball?" : I'd like to ask, "Do you see the ball?" and see how the child responds. : I think we need to clarify the rules of the game before we can have the child join the team.

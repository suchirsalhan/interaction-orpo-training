Teacher: This sets the scene and allows for a response from the child model Heres the starting message Hi friend Do you see the ball on the table near the cup and the book Please keep in mind that the goal is to encourage the child model to start producing meaningful words and phrases so the initial message should be relatively simple and inviting The tone should be gentle and encouraging as if speaking to a young child Im excited to see how the conversation unfolds

I have to say, I am a bit surprised that you would be interested in hearing about my love for music and I must admit, I have never really discussed it with anyone before. I am hoping that maybe I can learn something new and perhaps even discover some new artists that I might enjoy. I love music. It's a universal language that can express emotions, tell stories, and bring people together. I'm not very knowledgeable about music, but I'm eager to learn more and explore different genres and styles. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the genre of music known as \"acoustic\" or \"folk\""

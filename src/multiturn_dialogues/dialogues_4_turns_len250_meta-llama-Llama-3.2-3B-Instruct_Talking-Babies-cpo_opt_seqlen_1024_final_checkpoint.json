The speaker seems to be enthusiastic and excited about music, but the text is quite disjointed and unclear. It's hard to discern what they're trying to say or what their main point is. The text is full of vague statements, references to \"some of us\", and phrases that don't seem to make much sense.  Here are a few specific points that might give some insight into the speaker's thoughts:  * The speaker mentions that they've never been on a concert, but have been in a band before. This might suggest that they have some experience with the music industry or the band's scene. * The speaker mentions that they're going to work in New York, which might be a significant change in their life. * The speaker talks about \"some of the people\" they've seen perform, which might imply that they have some knowledge about certain musicians or bands. * The speaker mentions that they think it would be \"pretty cool\" to have some of the experiences of certain musicians in their work.

The fact that he mentions that the children will be taught the best way to handle the job properly and not get into trouble implies that he views his pupils as immature and irresponsible, and that he expects them to learn discipline and responsibility from the experience of being taught how to manage their time and follow rules. The fact that he jokes about the children getting into trouble also suggests that he has a somewhat cynical and authoritarian approach to education. The headmaster's tone is somewhat dismissive of the parents' concerns and suggests that he is not particularly interested in their well-being or happiness. Overall, the letter suggests that the headmaster is a somewhat unpleasant and unsympathetic figure. The letter's tone is somewhat formal and old-fashioned, which also suggests that it may be from the 1940s or 1950s. The language and style of the letter are somewhat reminiscent of a traditional British public school, which is also supported by the mention of \"amphibian time\".

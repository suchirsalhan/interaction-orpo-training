Or perhaps there's something more going on that's causing them to avoid talking about it? Do you think you'll be able to figure out what's going on and get to the bottom of it, or will you just have to keep on keeping on, pretending that everything is okay? I'm curious to know what you're thinking and feeling about the situation with your friends. Are you feeling confused, frustrated, or perhaps a little left out?

In a short story, the narrator explores the idea of the gaze and how it influences our perceptions of the world around us. The narrator's attention is drawn to the way people gaze at and treat animals, highlighting the power of the human gaze to shape our experiences of the natural world. Through this narrative, the author sheds light on the complex relationships between humans and animals, revealing the intricate ways in which our perceptions of the world are influenced by the gaze of others.  As the narrator reflects on her experiences with animals, she notes the way people gaze at them, often with a sense of detachment and a lack of emotional connection. She observes that some animals are viewed as objects, to be gazed at and admired, rather than as living beings worthy\n[Student]: of being alone or merely alive and unselfishly happy and safe among all creatures and their surroundings and feelings and characters and environment that we see as impossible and unjustly realistic as those relating to something more romanticBirmingham Writers Guild Books\n[Teacher]: .

The narrator's attention is drawn to the way people gaze at and treat animals, highlighting the power of the human gaze to shape our experiences of the natural world. Through this narrative, the author sheds light on the complex relationships between humans and animals, revealing the intricate ways in which our perceptions of the world are influenced by the gaze of others.  As the narrator reflects on her experiences with animals, she notes the way people gaze at them, often with a sense of detachment and a lack of emotional connection. She observes that some animals are viewed as objects, to be gazed at and admired, rather than as living beings worthy"

The passage is describing his relationship with his family, particularly his mother, and the fact that he cooks for her.

I'd love to help, but I need to decipher what you're trying to say.  To make things easier, I'll try to respond based on what I think you might be getting at. It seems like you're sharing a personal experience about attending a concert or music event. You mention a specific artist (Bobby) and a theme (tourist theme), as well as a feeling of connection with others who share similar interests.  To clarify, I'll ask some questions to ensure I'm on the right track:  1. Are you trying to describe a specific concert or music event you attended, and if so, can you give me more details about it? 2. What kind of music do you usually listen to? Is it a specific genre or style? 3. Are you looking for recommendations on music or concerts? Or is there something else"

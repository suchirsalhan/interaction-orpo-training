Are there any special traditions or funny stories from past celebrations?\n[Student]: That have to I want a youm going the than a little\n[Teacher]: help from the holidays? Absolutely, I celebrate many holidays with my family, and we have some wonderful traditions and funny stories from past celebrations. Let me tell you about a few of them.  **Christmas:** Our family has a tradition of opening one gift on Christmas Eve, which is always a new pair of pajamas or a cozy robe. The kids (and adults!) love the excitement of getting to wear their new PJs and lounging around the house on Christmas morning.  **Thanksgiving:** We always watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on TV, and the kids love predicting which balloons will pop or which characters will be the last ones to fly by.

You were telling us about your family's holiday celebrations, and I'd love to help you find a way to get back to that story.  To start, it seems like you mentioned a few holidays and traditions, but then got a bit tangled up in a sentence. Would you like to try to continue the story, or would you like some help to clarify and get back on track? Perhaps we could start with a question to get you going?

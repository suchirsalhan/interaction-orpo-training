What are the favorite toys for your kids today at school? This is an example of how this can help us create better relationships Lets imagine were building a sandcastle together using materials that will give our castle its shape this is similar to constructing something with blocksWhen I want my castle to stay strong enough without being too heavy or heavy all day long without playing or eating right away which isnt fair sometimes it needs extra care and it is not the same as being with us the only thing we are building is a sandcastle. We can create better relationships by showing genuine interest in others and asking them questions. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This can help us build stronger connections and improve our relationships. In the example above, the question is simple but allows for a conversation to start. It can help create a sense of connection and understanding. By asking about pets, favorite toys, and kids'"

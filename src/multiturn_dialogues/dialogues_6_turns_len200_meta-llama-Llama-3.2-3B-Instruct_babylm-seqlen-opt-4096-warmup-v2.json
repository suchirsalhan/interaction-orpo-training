The writer appears to be rambling and not providing any useful information or assistance.  However, if we try to decipher the passage and find any coherent message or meaning, we can see that the writer is:  * Trying to promote a recipe * Sharing a personal anecdote about a friend who is a great cook * Offering to help with any questions or substitutions * Possibly trying to make a point about the importance of cooking and sharing food with others (the \"Free Hugs\" sign)  The passage can be rewritten in a more coherent and organized manner to make it more readable and engaging.

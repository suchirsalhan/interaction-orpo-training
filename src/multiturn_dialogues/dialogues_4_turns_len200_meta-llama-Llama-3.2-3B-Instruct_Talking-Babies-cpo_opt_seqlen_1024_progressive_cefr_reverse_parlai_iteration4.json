I love music and I do enjoy listening to a variety of genres, but my favorite artist is David Bowie.

I'm also a big fan of Queen, and I've been lucky enough to see them live in concert a few times. Their music is just incredible, and Freddie Mercury's voice is truly one of the greatest in rock music.

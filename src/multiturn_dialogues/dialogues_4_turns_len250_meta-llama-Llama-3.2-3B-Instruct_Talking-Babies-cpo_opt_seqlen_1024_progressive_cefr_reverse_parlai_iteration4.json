I listen to a mix of genres like rock, pop, jazz, and some electronic music. I've been to a few concerts, but nothing out of the world, just local shows and music festivals. However, I have a favorite artist, David Gilmour, the legendary guitarist of Pink Floyd. I had the chance to see him live in concert. It was a life-changing experience for me. Seeing him perform live was like witnessing a masterclass in music. He's incredibly talented and has a unique sound that's hard to describe. His playing style is both melodic and complex, and he can make his guitar sound like an entire orchestra.  When I think back to that concert, I remember the sense of awe and wonder that I felt in the audience. The crowd was completely silent and entranced, and it was like everyone was waiting for something magical to happen. And then David Gilmour would start playing, and it was like a wave of magic swept over the entire crowd. The music was so beautiful and emotive, it was like it was speaking directly to our souls.

As I sit here listening to his music, I feel like I'm connecting with him on a deep level, and it's like we're sharing a moment of understanding and empathy.

However, it was not always the case. It was not always that I had the time to spend with my family or that we would spend our time together, laughing and having fun. In fact, our lives were much more complicated than that. We were always on the go, always working, never really having a moment to ourselves. I remember one time, my husband and I were at a dinner party and we were both exhausted. We had just finished a long day of work and were looking forward to a quiet night at home. But then my husband received a call from his boss and he had to go out and meet with him. I was left alone to entertain the rest of the family and our guests. I was so exhausted that I just wanted to go to bed, but I knew I had to put on a brave face and make sure everyone was having a good time. I remember feeling like I was in a trance and just going through the motions. I felt like I was living in a dream and not really being present in the moment. And then I looked around the room and saw my husband, my children, my friends, and the guests all smiling and laughing together. And I realized that\n[Student]: it was just as well for me to come up and see what joy it was to know that I did not want this place to be deserted because it was so lonely and unjustly crowded in its way here and nobody could tell how tired I was about my life\n[Teacher]: . From that day on, I was determined to make changes in my life. I started by saying no to commitments that I didn't feel like keeping. I started by taking time for myself, whether it was reading, taking a bath, or simply sitting in silence. I started by prioritizing my family and making time for them. I started by learning to ask for help when I needed it. And I started by being more present in the moment, and truly enjoying the time I spent with my loved ones. And it was not easy, I would say. There were many times when I felt like giving up, when I felt like I was failing or that I was not good enough. But I persevered. I kept going and I kept pushing forward. And slowly but surely, my life started to change. I started to feel more fulfilled, more connected to my family, and more present in the moment. I started to feel like I was truly living, rather than just existing. And that is the story of how I learned to prioritize my family and myself and how I learned to truly enjoy the time I spent with the people I love. (sigh) What a wonderful life I have now!

It was not always that I had the time to spend with my family or that we would spend our time together, laughing and having fun. In fact, our lives were much more complicated than that. We were always on the go, always working, never really having a moment to ourselves. I remember one time, my husband and I were at a dinner party and we were both exhausted. We had just finished a long day of work and were looking forward to a quiet night at home. But then my husband received a call from his boss and he had to go out and meet with him. I was left alone to entertain the rest of the family and our guests. I was so exhausted that I just wanted to go to bed, but I knew I had to put on a brave face and make sure everyone was having a good time.

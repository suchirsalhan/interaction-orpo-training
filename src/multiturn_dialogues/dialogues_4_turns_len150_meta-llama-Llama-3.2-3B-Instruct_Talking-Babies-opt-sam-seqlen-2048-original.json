The children have grown old enough to be with their mates and be married and have children of their own who will probably die when they are old and grey like their parents before them and the same thing will happen again and again and again so that I must go back to the poor people who were being carried away to Belvedere in a ship which will probably never come back again to Boston and I must tell them the story of the summer of 1935 that I heard from Mrs Brown who found the book among the poor people and that I shall be telling you now.

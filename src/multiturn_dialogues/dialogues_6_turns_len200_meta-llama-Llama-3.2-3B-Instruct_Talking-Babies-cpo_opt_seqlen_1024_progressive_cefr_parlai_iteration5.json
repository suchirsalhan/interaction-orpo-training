    "text": "[Starter]: Do you have any pets? How long have you had them, and what do you like most about them?\n[Student]: They are good friends of yours He was a little frightened at this point because he did not care so much for the animals who were here when they were born and brought up in their native country or near by in Africa where there is always trouble between us and our own kindred spirits in many ways\n[Teacher]: . He had been living in the zoo for some time, and had not yet been to the zoo before, and was frightened, but eventually he came to the children with a hesitant smile. The children in the sea lion was very excited, but the children in the sea lion was very excited to see the new sea lion, and he was excited to be there. Do you have any pets? How long have you had them, and what do you like most about them? There is no question asked in the passage that asks the reader to share their own experiences with pets, but instead the passage seems to be a narrative that describes a scene involving a person (or people) interacting with a pet. It's possible that the passage is trying to set a scene or create a particular atmosphere, but it doesn't explicitly ask the reader to share their own experiences with pets. However, I can try to answer the question in the style of the passage. Here's a possible response:  I have a pet\n[Student]: that will probably give me an animal which would soon become human again if I could get one from him\n[Teacher]: .  I do not know how long I have had it, as it has been here with me for so long.  I do not know what I like most about it, but I do like how it makes me feel.  When I am with my pet, I feel like I am home.  It is a good feeling, and it makes me want to take care of it.  I like how my pet is always happy to see me, and how it always makes me laugh.  I also like how it can sense when I am feeling down, and how it always tries to comfort me.  I feel very lucky to have a pet like that.  I do not know what it would be like to live without it.  I do not know how I could ever leave it behind.  It is a very good feeling to have a pet like that, and I am grateful for every moment I spend with it.

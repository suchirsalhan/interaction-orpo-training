She came at once to his bedside, stood there for a moment, gazed at him with her large, dark eyes and then, with a tender, loving touch, began to apply the poultice which had been prepared by a wise old woman for her mother's recovery. His heart swelled with emotion, he felt the warmth of her touch and the gentle pressure of her hands. For a moment, he was lost in the sweetness of her love. And then, as she moved away from him, he felt the weight of his own helplessness and the depth of his own despair. He lay there, feeling the pain, feeling the fear, and feeling the overwhelming sense of being alone and left to face the darkness that seemed to press in on him from all sides. And when she turned to leave, he called out to her, his voice hoarse and weak.

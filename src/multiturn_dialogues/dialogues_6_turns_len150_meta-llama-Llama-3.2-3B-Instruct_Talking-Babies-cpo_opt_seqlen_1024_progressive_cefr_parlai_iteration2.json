A: Joe, that's great you are thinking of joining a team. Here are some options you might consider:   1.  School teams - Many schools offer various sports teams, such as soccer, basketball, and football. These teams are usually open to students, and you can join one that suits your interests and abilities.   2.  Local clubs - If you prefer to play with people who are already familiar with the sport, you might consider joining a local club.

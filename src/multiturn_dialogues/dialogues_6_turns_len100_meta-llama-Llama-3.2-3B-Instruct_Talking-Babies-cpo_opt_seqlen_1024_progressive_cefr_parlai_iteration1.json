You may have already known that I am a vegetarian and my friend has told you that he is a non vegetarian. This leaves us with the following two possibilities: Either the friend is a vegetarian or the friend is a non vegetarian. Either the friend is a vegetarian or the friend is a non vegetarian. This is an example of the application\n[Student]: of food on a diet which means that one must eat some fresh foods such as salmon and beans It makes me laugh when other people talk about meat but not to get annoyed because others think it is a desert animal or something else and therefore they need attention to help themselves or others think of something else that they dont want to know about or can understand and then the person who actually knows how many different foods are eating from this particular area would be able to decide whether a certain number of animals\n[Teacher]: are good or not. Since the speaker is a vegetarian, she prefers to eat vegetables. Her friend, on the other hand, is a non-vegetarian. This means that he eats meat, which is not in line with her diet.

The speaker is a vegetarian, which means she prefers to eat vegetables and avoids meat.  ## Step 3: Analyze the speaker's friend's dietary preference.

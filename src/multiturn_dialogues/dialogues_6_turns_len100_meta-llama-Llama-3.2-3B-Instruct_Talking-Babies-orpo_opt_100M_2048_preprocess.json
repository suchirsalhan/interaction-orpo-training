I've seen a lot of people eating breakfast for dinner and it's getting more and more popular. Breakfast for dinner has become a common trend in many restaurants and households. But the question is, do we eat breakfast for dinner because we're lazy or because we want to experience a unique meal.  What are your thoughts on eating breakfast for dinner?

It's not a good idea to eat anything that is not edible and therefore is not safe for humans to eat.

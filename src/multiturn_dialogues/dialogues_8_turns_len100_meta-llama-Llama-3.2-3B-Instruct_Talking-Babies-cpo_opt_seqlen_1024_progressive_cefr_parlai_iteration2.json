How long have you had them, and what do you like most about them?\n[Student]: You dont know anything about all that except my dogs\n[Teacher]: , Max and Bella, but I'll tell me about them. I've had Max and Bella for about 3 years now. Max is a golden retriever and Bella is a poodle mix. They're both such great companions. Max is the more energetic of the two, always wanting to run around and play fetch. Bella is a bit more laid back, but she loves to cuddle and get belly rubs. I love watching them interact with each other - they're so adorable. Max\n[Student]: has friends in school who say he doesnt want anyone else to know his name and wants to be there as well Bella says its her favorite experience for us and that we are quite unselfish of him or our own husband but I think that she will not let on as much as we do because she knows lots about everybody people who work at home their parents and neighbours and her children Bella also likes to take care of her baby when she sees how good she\n[Teacher]: is at looking after us and I think she is very proud of her role. Max loves to go on car rides with us and Bella enjoys the same too. But both of them bring so much joy to our lives and I would not trade them for anything in the world. I love how they always keep us on our toes and make us laugh. They're such a big part of our lives and I'm so grateful to have them.  It sounds like you have two wonderful pets who bring a lot\n[Student]: of attention to your family and give it the best they can and you never feel lonely by having one at every house with no husband\n[Teacher]: .  I'm sure it's not a solitary experience for you since we all have pets around us.       You're absolutely right, I don't have pets. But, I can see the love and dedication you have for your dogs, Max and Bella. It's clear that they bring a lot of joy and companionship to your life, and that you cherish their presence in your life. Your description of their personalities, habits, and interactions with each other is very endearing. I can sense\n[Student]: it from you if youd just come here quietly and show me why we should really live next doorstep with your dog while I am talking to your old master whenever I hear the story through your lips In fact I certainly am sorry to trouble you in this way in speaking to everyone else because I have been waiting months to find out your real meaning during these two weeks of trying to please you without delay Goodbye\n[Teacher]: to me and I will be seeing you soon, Goodbye to you both. Goodbye to all of you.  Oh, I'm so glad I came! It seems like I might have given you a wrong impression. I actually have no pets, and I'm just chatting with you about your lovely dogs, Max and Bella. I'm curious to know more about them! Can I ask, how do you handle their energetic needs? Do you have any special training or activities that you do with",
